Note that there were two later working drafts: N869 and N878, but they seem to have been removed from the WG14 website, so this is the latest one available.

## Difference between Standards

- C90 vs C89

  > Almost the same as ANSI X3.159-198 (C89) except for the frontmatter and section numbering. There is at least one textual difference in section 6.5.7 (previously 3.5.7), where "a list" became "a brace-enclosed list". Note that the conversion between ANSI and ISO/IEC Standard is seen inside this document, the document refers to its name as "ANSI/ISO: 9899/99" although this isn't the right name of the later made standard of it, the right name is "ISO/IEC 9899:1990"
