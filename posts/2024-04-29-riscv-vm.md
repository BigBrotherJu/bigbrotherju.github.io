- U bit

  The U bit indicates whether the page is accessible to user mode.

  - U mode 下只能访问 U=1 的页

    U-mode software may only access the page when U=1.

  - S mode 下一般不能访问 U=1 的页

    If the `SUM` bit in the `sstatus` register is set, supervisor mode software may also access pages with U=1.

    However, supervisor code normally operates with the `SUM` bit clear, in which case, supervisor code will fault on accesses to user-mode pages.

  - S mode 不能执行 U=1 的页

    Irrespective of SUM, the supervisor may not execute code on pages with U=1.
